            <p class="fresh">Freshmean year, I was in Interior Design. In this project we had to choose a 3D cardboard cutout of the first letter of our name and paint it with a design of our own. We could use anything that will help us in creating the design. Tape was used to make the stripes.

                For our PBL, we needed to design a chair as a team. The chair was an old chair and we could design it any way we wanted to. My team took colors from a color wheel pallete and pasted them on the chair. We went with a pattern of black, with any shade of blue, then back to black, and any shade of red. We added a checkerbaord design to some areas and used multiple shades of another color on the sides.

            First thing I was introduced to once I joined Web Design was a photoshop assignment. I was cluesless as to what to do even with intructions in front of me. The instructions werent intructions for a beginner, so technical terms are what slowed me down. Thanks to my wonderful classmates, I received help and was able get a good grade on the assignment. The assignment had a couple options. My option had to create an eerie landscape with a worn down tree house.

            Everyone at the time was new to a program called Flash. We worked on creating 2D background and perspectives. we used three props, a tree, a rock, and a bush. Using these three props we create a forest with three different perspectives. One layer up front, one in the middle, and one in the back. This assignment was an easy one for me.

            In Web, started off with learning how to create HTML pages for our portfolio. The porfolio was a small portfolio meant for that class only. In each lesson, we would learn an extra skill and implement it into our portfolio. Once we learned the basics of HTML, we learned CSS and one step at a time, designed our portfolio to our likings. Ofcourse, some of the websites werent perfect, we still had a lot of learning ahead of us.

            A PBL called GirlInTech was a major project in web. In a group of six people, with girls as leaders, we needed to create a presentation that will teach girls, who are sixth and seventh grade, about something in the technology field. My group taught the girls Adobe Kuler. Adobe Kuler is an application both on the Web and Apple devices that help anyone create a color scheme for anything that needs it. We had an electronic handout and three speakers. The rest of the group were walking around helping anyone who needs it.

        <p class="junior"> In this project we were assigned to design logos for an organization called ACTE. Multiple sketches were made and the final two were chosen. Aterwords, we improved them in illustrator and added color. The tenets involved would be writing skills and work ethic.
            <br> I learned that although we only had to make a couple sketches, it can be difficult creating different models for a logo. Most would think it wouldnt take too long to create skectches but I did get stuck a few times thinking of a new model.

        <p class="junior"> Culture Shock was a dance organization we worked with. Students that range from 5-16 came to visit SWCTA and taught us some dance moves, in return we taught then about some stuff we do in Web Design. The tenets involved in this project would be communication/teamwork, presentation, and work ethic.
            <br> What I learned was how to dance like a pro. It took alot of communication to actually dance as a group. It was actually pretty hard to have everyone dancing in unison, even with simple dance moves.

        <p class="junior"> Infographics are a big part when it comes to graphic design. In Graphic Design we were assigned to do an infographic of any choice. My partner and I chose to do an infographic on popular cat videos because it would be a funny topic to do. The tenets involved would be content knowledge, teamwork, and work ethic.
            <br> I learned that while working on a group project its important to keep communication and deadlines. We were both rushing towards the end of the deadline. It came out well and the presentation still went the way we planned it to.
