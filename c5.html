            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The chapter begins at the front of Nick’s house, where Gatsby and Nick discuss the proper day for Daisy’s visit and a job opportunity that Gatsby is offering to Nick. The setting shifts to Nick’s home where Gatsby and Daisy meet for the first time in years and they enjoy a rainy afternoon together. It was a bit rough at first, seeing each other, but after some time, they developed a more close relationship. The final scene includes Gatsby’s house. Gatsby invites Daisy and Nick to give a tour of his house, inside and out.</p>
            <h3>Characterization</h3>
            <h4>Nick Carraway</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>In this chapter, the attention is focused less on Nick and more on Gatsby and Daisy. Nick seems very intelligent and wise to the way he handles the situations between Gatsby and him and Daisy and Gatsby. </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>(To Gatsby)</i> “Your place looks like the World’s Fair” (Fitzgerald 81). “I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through” (Fitzgerald 91). As Nick and Daisy take the tour of Gatsby’s house, Nick makes this remark to show how different the environment of Gatsby’s house is, now that he has a prestigious guest over. </li>
                <li><strong>Other Characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Gatsby</i>: “Why I thought---why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money do you” (Fitzgerald 82).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jay Gatsby</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Gatsby is first very doubtful as he readies to see Daisy again, yet he becomes lovestruck once he comes face to face with her.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “...and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes” (Fitzgerald 84). <i>Narrator</i>: “Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets…” (Fitzgerald 86). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “This is a terrible mistake… A terrible, terrible mistake” (Fitzgerald 87). Once he sees that Daisy is late and she might never show up, he thinks about canceling the surprised meeting and just heading back to his house. </li>
                <li><strong>Other Characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Nick</i>: “You’re acting like a little boy… Not only that but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone” (Fitzgerald 88). <i>Narrator</i>: “He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room” (Fitzgerald 89).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Daisy Buchanan</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car” (Fitzgerald 85). <i>Narrator</i>: “Daisy’s face was smeared with tears” (Fitzgerald 89) </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one” (Fitzgerald 85). “I certainly am awfully glad to see you again” (Fitzgerald 86). “I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone” (Fitzgerald 90). Daisy expresses her thoughts as she receives a tour of Gatsby’s house. </li>
                <li><strong>Other Characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “Daisy’s embarrassed too” (Fitzgerald 87). Once she and Gatsby finally meet, Gatsby becomes hesitant and tries to escape the scene, but Nick calms him down by ensuring him that not only he is nervous or embarrassed to be present at the situation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>The past’s impact on the future is the focal point of this chapter, along with sincerity of character, as demonstrated by the actions of Gatsby and Daisy during their meeting coordinated by Nick. The qualms of Gatsby’s past allegiances are finally given connection when he struggles to reclaim what was once grand between Daisy and himself under the assumption that her feelings did not persist. At the point of actualization during their critical meeting, it is eventually made clear that their emotions were maintained and are mutual, as reflected by their mannerisms and forthright tone of genuine happiness during the scene. However, Gatsby’s clumsy wrestling with thoughts of the past and their initial realization in the present -- idealizing Daisy to a possibly inactual degree -- made it difficult for their comfort to be established and for their character traits to be fully apparent.</p>
