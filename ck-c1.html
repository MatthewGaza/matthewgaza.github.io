            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The story is centered during the 1910s and 1920s, around the World War I era. This chapter&rsquo;s setting focuses on the East and West Egg of Long Island, New York. Nick&rsquo;s home is in the West Egg, which is a less appealing neighborhood compared to East Egg, where East Egg is more luxurious. Only fine-looking house on West Egg is Jay Gatsby&rsquo;s house, which is next door. The author, Nick Carraway, visits the home of Daisy and Tom Buchanan in East Egg, which he describes as &quot;cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay&quot; (6).</p>

            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>The geographic distinction between East Egg and West Egg marks a conflict of themes that is likely to dominate the remainder of the novel. East egg is portrayed as a place of refinement and culture, whereas its West Egg counterpart represents a lack of both; their inhabitants are reflective of this, and commentary detailings of them set the stage for future happenings that are to unfold in adherence to said themes. For example, Carraway&rsquo;s narration of his experience with Daisy, Tom Buchanan, and Jordan introduces an aristocratic, &rsquo;superior&rsquo; pattern that contrasts the gothic behemoth that is the West Egg lifestyle. This implies that the characters respective to each side of the thematic parallel are bound to clash, regardless of whether or not they have yet to interconnect. The first chapter, as it should, plants the seeds of conflict and resolution that are to sprout as progress holds. </p>
