            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The chapter begins in Gatsby’s house, where they enjoy a cigarette, which leads to Gatsby’s story of how he met Daisy. The setting is then revealed to be at Daisy’s house, in Louisville, 1917, when Gatsby first laid eyes on Daisy. The setting then transitions back to Gatsby’s house, where it is dawn, and Nick and Gatsby just finish their breakfast. Nick leaves Gatsby to catch the train that would transport him to his work. Afterwards, there is a flashback to the accident with Myrtle Wilson, where George Wilson is receiving the interview that would hopefully reveal what truly happened to his wife and how her death should be honored.</p>
            <h3>Characterization</h3>

            <h4>Nick Carraway</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “They’re a rotten crowd” (Fitzgerald 154). As this becomes one of the last words that Nick expresses to Gatsby before Gatsby’s death, Nick wanted to ensure Gatsby that he was worth way more than the Buchanans and their friends. Nick tells him this because Gatsby was experiencing a low self-esteem after Tom spoke about him. Nick hoped this would cheer him up.</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - Jordan: “You weren’t so nice to me last night” (Fitzgerald 155).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jay Gatsby</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport” (Fitzgerald 150). During the time he spent with Daisy, Gatsby developed types of feelings he had never developed for another person, which he found to be quite astounding and exciting. “I don’t think she ever loved him” (Fitzgerald 152).</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “She [Daisy] thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her…” (Fitzgerald 150). <i>Nick</i>: “You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together” (Fitzgerald 154).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Daisy Buchanan</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - Narrator: “...and once he [Gatsby] kissed her dark shining hair” (Fitzgerald 150).</li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all” (Fitzgerald 151). Daisy felt that she needed Gatsby more than anybody else. Although, she could not have waited any longer, since Gatsby was in Oxford. Since her time had come to grow up and find someone to spend her life with, she chose Tom Buchanan, since his social status was so high and his wealth was like no other’s. Although, she still truly loved Gatsby.</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, action</strong> - <i>Gatsby</i>: “I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too” (Fitzgerald 150).</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>The eighth chapter brings to life the culmination of all the primary conflicts the book lays out. Tom’s infidelity reaches its resolution, Gatsby and his dream are completely laid to rest, Wilson’s suspicions are confirmed, and the vengeful eyes of God channeled through those of Dr. Eckleburg are paid mind. The conflict between Tom and Gatsby that prompted their departure as separate parties is what led to their fatal accident with Myrtle, which resulted in Wilson’s analysis of the daunting billboard and the ultimate death of Jay Gatsby. This chapter is the cohesive unit that binds together each conflict by connecting them to one another through intertwined character relations and actions; a fateful domino effect is set forth, and its results were just as destiny had ordained. This chapter also brings to light the source of Gatsby’s undying attraction to Daisy through his melancholic recount of it to Nick. He details her massive wealth and superior social status, implying that his love for her, as well as his love for wealth and success, was highly materialistic. When his wealthy dream had ended, so too did his wealthy life.</p>
