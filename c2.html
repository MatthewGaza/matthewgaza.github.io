            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p><i>Valley of ashes</i> - halfway between West Egg and New York. &quot;...a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens...&quot; (23). <i>George B. Wilson&rsquo;s garage</i> - &quot;The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land.&quot; (24) <i>Apartment at 158th Street</i> - &quot;The apartment was on the top floor---a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath.&quot;</p>
            <h3>Characterization</h3>
            <h4>George B. Wilson</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>He is seen as someone that is unextravagant, colorless, and messy. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;He was a blond... his light blue eyes&quot; (25). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>(When asked about business)</i> &quot;I can&rsquo;t complain&quot; (25). &quot;Works pretty slow don&rsquo;t he?&quot; (25). &quot;I don&rsquo;t mean that... I just meant-----&quot; (25). </li>
                <li><strong>Other Characters&rsquo; thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome&quot; (25). <i>Tom</i>: &quot;He&rsquo;s so dumb he doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s alive&quot; (26).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Myrtle Wilson</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>She is seen as devious, demanding, desperate. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue cr&ecirc;pe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smoldering&quot; (25). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, actions, feelings</strong> - &quot;Get some chairs, why don&rsquo;t you, so somebody can sit down&quot; (26). &quot;I want to get one of those dogs... I want to get one for the apartment. They&rsquo;re nice to have--a dog&quot; (27). &quot;I think it&rsquo;s cute&quot; (28). &quot;I married him because I thought he was a gentleman... I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn&rsquo;t fit to lick my shoe&quot; (34). </li>
                <li><strong>Other Characters&rsquo; thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Tom</i>: &quot;It does her good to get away&quot; (26).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Catherine (Myrtle&rsquo;s sister)</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again&quot; (30). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;These people! You have to keep after them all the time&quot; (32). <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: &rsquo;Neither of them can stand the person they&rsquo;re married to&rsquo;&quot; (33).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Chester McKee</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>He is viewed as prideful and bragging </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below.&quot; </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;I&rsquo;ve done some nice things out on Long Island&quot; (32). &quot;I&rsquo;d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.&quot; (33).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Mrs. Mckee</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Presented as someone &quot;shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible&quot; <strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;I like your dress. I think it&rsquo;s adorable&quot; (31). &quot;If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it&quot; (31).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>Firstly, the introduction of the valley of ashes is of a strikingly dissimilar aura to the lavishness described in the opening chapter. Its desolation defines all that would conflict with the inhabitants of wealthier regions at face value, such as those in East Egg. Secondly, the author&rsquo;s infiltration of this contrast through the eyes of his narrator works to provide a set of conflicts and themes that are likely to be traced throughout the plotline. Once again, the viewpoint of Nick Carraway took the helm of the reader&rsquo;s conceptual direction, and this viewpoint, during the second chapter, offered particular insight into the dealings of Tom Buchanan. Upon observation, it is immediately apparent that Carraway&rsquo;s perception of the scene at Buchanan&rsquo;s party was less than favorable, and his temptation to depart clarified this. Buchanan&rsquo;s overbearance ruled his presence, as exemplified by his commanding of Carraway, his taunting of George Wilson, and his climaxing physical strike against Myrtle. These examples each accumulated a tower of conflict that topples upon Carraway and the spectators of the scene.</p>
