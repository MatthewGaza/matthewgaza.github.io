    <h2 class="Aphead"> Hearthstone app review, blog assignment</h2>
    <p class="App"> After spending a good week or two playing Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, I have become very fond of the game. Although this type of game has been done before, it is not just a mindless click and drag game. Strategic planning against opponents is required to ensure victory. Overall I give the game a 9/10.

        <br> Hearthstone provides the players with anticipation towards each card pack and what new strategies can be made with each new set of cards. The tutorial given was simple and gave the player an understanding of the game. Although the tutorial only allowed you to use one hero, their are eight others the player can use to their liking. As for the card packs, they are not hard to get and daily quests are given to aid the player. One card could always end up being the game changer.

        <br>The reason 9/10 was given was due to usability. Having played the game on an iPad2, iPhone4s, and PC, lag can be an issue. Yes, the other two devices are of lower generations, but Hearthstone should have a stability options to maybe lower some settings to help players with lower generation devices be lag and crash free. Offline mode also isnt available. The game requires an internet connection and cannot be played offline. This should be implemented for players who do not have access to internet for practice against Ai.

        <br>The game as a whole is a great game. I became attached to the game and started playing it daily. The game has a lot of upsides and only a few downsides which will hopefully be changed in the future.

    <h4> reflection</h4>
    <p class="App"> In this assignment I was assigned to create a blog on any topic. The topic I decided to choose was app reviews. The first app I reviewed would be the game Hearthstone heroes of warcraft. What I learned from this assignment was that you need much more than just a week in order to give a full review of an app. I was also limited the blog format, as in I was limited in how much I could write. Part of the requirements was that most blog posts are only about 250 words. This stopped me from writing more than I did, even witht he simplified text, I surpassed the limit by about 20 words.</p>
