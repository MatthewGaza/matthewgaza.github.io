            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The chapter begins with Nick at Gatsby's house, where he encounters an unfamiliar butler and is ensured that Gatsby is doing fine. Gatsby has also hired new servants. The setting then transitions to the Buchanan residency, where Gatsby, Nick, and Jordan are all present. Then, the five adults take a trip to the city, where the truth between Gatsby and Daisy is revealed. This includes a stop at Wilson's garage. On their way, Tom, Jordan, and Nick took Gatsby's car while Daisy and Gatsby took Tom's car. On their way back, they stop at Wilson's garage again, only to see that Myrtle was caught in a hit-and-run and was instantly killed.</p>
            <h3>Characterization</h3>
            <h4>Nick Carraway</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, and actions</strong> - "I wanted to get up and slap him on the back" (Fitzgerald 129). "No... I just remembered that today's my birthay" (Fitzgerald 135). <i>(About Wilson)</i> "He was his wife's man and not his own" (Fitzgerald 136). "I'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of al of them today, and suddenly that included Jordan too" (Fitzgerald 142).</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters' thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Jordan:</i> "Won't you come in, Nick" (Fitzgerald 142).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Daisy Buchanan</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth” Fitzgerald 116). “We’re getting old… If we were young we’d rise and dance” (Fitzgerald 128). “Why--how could I love him--possibly” (Fitzgerald 132). <i>Gatsby</i>: “Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back” (Fitzgerald 143).</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans” (Fitzgerald 115). <i>Jordan</i>: “What a low, vulgar girl” (Fitzgerald 116). <i>Nick</i>: “She’s got an indiscreet voice… It’s full of---” (Fitzgerald 120).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jordan Baker</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>To Daisy</i>: “Don’t be morbid… Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the Fall” (Fitzgerald 118). Jordan, who tackles life independently, is wise about comforting Daisy when she worries about the future.</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age” (Fitzgerald 135).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jay Gatsby</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>In this chapter, Gatsby is revealed as a fierce, verbally strong, and fearless man, defending himself and the sake of the relationship he has with Daisy.</li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “Your wife doesn’t love you… She’s never loved you. She loves me” (Fitzgerald 130). At this point, the truth had been revealed about Daisy and Gatsby, which sends Tom in a pool of strict denial and confusion. “What about it… I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it” (Fitzgerald 134). Now, the attention is directed towards the flaws of each character, Tom and Gatsby. With Tom accusing Gatsby about his work with drugs, Gatsby was able to defend himself with the different evidence he had lined up.</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Daisy</i>: “You always look so cool” (Fitzgerald 119). <i>Tom</i>: “An Oxford man!... Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit” (Fitzgerald 122).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tom Buchanan</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Tom’s character sees an improvement in this chapter, where he reveals a small degree of compassion and empathy for characters like, Mr. Wilson.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike” (Fitzgerald 116).</li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “He was astounded. His mouth open a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy, as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago” (Fitzgerald 119). Tom’s reaction when he witnesses the flirtation that was happening between Daisy and Gatsby is a remarkable checkpoint in the story. “Wreck!... That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business at last” (Fitzgerald 137).</li>
                <li><strong>Other Characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Nick</i>: “He won’t touch her… He’s not thinking about her” (Fitzgerald 144). <i>Gatsby</i>: “I don’t trust him, old sport” (Fitzgerald 144).</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>This chapter surfaces the latent conflict that had been stirring between Gatsby and Tom since Gatsby’s reunion with Daisy. Tom’s confrontation leads to his direct questioning of Gatsby’s relations with Daisy, facilitating the rebuttal that Daisy’s emotional loyalty remained with Gatsby even after their blissful past. Throughout the quarrel, however, Daisy finds herself growing ever closer to Tom, creating an emotional crossroad that causes Gatsby’s dream to depart further from reality. It is becoming increasingly clear to Gatsby that his loving conquest is not a fruitful endeavor at this point in the story, but his deep love for Daisy keeps his persistence alive and his heart adrift. His determination is illustrated thoroughly when he surrenders all that makes him grand to become a pitiful and helpless watchman from afar through the window and bushes that separate his dream from existence. Just as Gatsby once awaited his dream’s arrival from across the dock with outstretched arms, he now awaits the arrival of his love’s actualization from the other side of the river -- the location that spawned forth all he desires -- in a striking parallel of themes. </p>
