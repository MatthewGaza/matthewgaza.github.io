            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The chapter begins with Nick two years later from Gatsby’s death, where he looks back at the event and describes the chaos that took place at his house with the police, photographers, and newspaper men. He visits Wolfsheim’s office, since it is the quickest and most accurate form of communication. At this point, he finds out that he will not be attending his funeral. The funeral was held at late Gatsby’s house. The rest of the story involves Nick stumbling upon past characters like Tom and Jordan and their final agreement to the relationship they will continue together.</p>
            <h3>Characterization</h3>
            <h4>Nick Carraway</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon” (Fitzgerald 171). “I’m thirty… I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it an honor” (Fitzgerald 177). “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made” (Fitzgerald 179).</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Tom</i>: “You’re crazy, Nick… Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you” (Fitzgerald 178).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Meyer Wolfsheim</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong></li> - “This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all” (Fitzgerald 166). As a close friend, Meyer finds it astonishing how Gatsby ended his life so suddenly, yet later on, it’s revealed the type of friend he turns out by not attending his funeral.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mr. Gatz</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “...his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears” (Fitzgerald 168).</li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like Jame J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country” (Fitzgerald 168). As his father, he had a strong belief in his son. His expensive house and everything that made it up put a huge smile on his face. He saw that his own son, a once farm boy, was able to achieve great success in his life. Even though he is heart broken for the loss of his son, he feels content knowing that he was a successful man. “Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows up well” (Fitzgerald 172). </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>In the final chapter, an analytic resolution is set to finalize the book’s themes and draw conclusions that can be traced throughout the work’s entirety. Just as they once did during his lavish life, reporters and gossipers invaded Gatsby’s funeral, resulting in preposterous assumptions and wild theories surrounding his death. Nick organized the funeral in a manner that he thought Gatsby would approve of, welcoming all friends and acquaintances to attend, only to greet a select few. Among them stood Henry C. Gatz, Gatsby’s father. He details young Gatsby’s tendencies, and points out his determination for improvement from a very early age, contributing to his development. Western America, in its historical context, while lacking in superficial beauty, thrived in moral vitality. This is why the main characters, all Westerners by birth, had such a disorienting experience with adjusting to the morally desolate way of life in the East. In their conquest for wealth and social success, they were distorted by the land and its deceptive surface devoid of human value. As he is perceived by Nick’s morally correct eyes, which were established early in the book, Gatsby is the representation of impossible determination, helpless drifting from the past, and the idealization of the aristocratic roots which America once defied -- the embodiment of the disillusioned American dream. </p>
