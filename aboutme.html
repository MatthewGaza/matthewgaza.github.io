            <p class="AB"> I am looking forward to the many opporunities I have. Although I do not know everything about coding, I am willing to learn and adapt to the changing world. The first time I grew interest in becoming a Web Developer was during the end of my Freshmen Year. I Transfered into the Web Design program area of my school in SWCTA. After learning a few bits of code and making my own functional website, I was hooked and wante it to be my career. I continued the program area up to my senior year. Each year I was presented with new and efficient ways of coding and was able to refine what I knew.

            <p class="AB"> My name is Matthew Gaza. I was born in the city of San Fernando, Philippines. I moved to Guam and lived there for most of my childhood. I moved to Washington for about a year and drove down to vegas where I have lived since. I am typically a quiet and reserved person but I will speak up and show myself when it is needed. Most of the time, you will see me listening to music regardless of what I am doing. </p>

        <p class="AB"> My name is Matthew Gaza and I am in the Web Design Program for SWCTA. I enjoy the program Web Design and I am planning to have it as my future career. Although I haven't learned everything about Web Design, I am ready for anything else needed to improve myself. Because of the school I am in, I have the advantage of taking a Web Design course. I believe that even if creating and designing a website takes alot of knowledge in coding, the most important skill that is needed in almost everything is creativity. </p>
        <p class="AB"> I have lived in Las Vegas, Nevada for Six years now. I was born in the philippines and moved to Guam. I lived in Guam for most my childhood until I moved to Washington in the summer before 5th grade. Although washington was a fun experience, I moved to Las Vegas a year later. Most people would have taken a plane to Las Vegas, my family and I drove down to Vegas to enjoy the extra scenes the drive has to offer. </p>
        <p class="AB">I am a student in Southwest CTA and currently in the Web Design program. Unlike most my classmates, I wasnt in Web Design for my Freshmen year. My first year in SWCTA, I was in the Interior Design program. Interior Design was a good class to be in, but I didn't have much interest in it as I thought i would. The next year, I transffered into Web Design. I may have lacked one year in learning programs useful to web design, but that doesnt stop me from learning more. </p>
