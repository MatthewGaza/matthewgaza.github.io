    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <div class="Abt">
        <p class="AB"> My name is Matthew Gaza and I am in the Web Design Program for SWCTA. I enjoy the program Web Design and I am planning to have it as my future career. Although I haven't learned everything about Web Design, I am ready for anything else needed to improve myself. Because of the school I am in, I have the advantage of taking a Web Design course. I believe that even if creating and designing a website takes alot of knowledge in coding, the most important skill that is needed in almost everything is creativity. </p>
        <p class="AB"> I have lived in Las Vegas, Nevada for Six years now. I was born in the philippines and moved to Guam. I lived in Guam for most my childhood until I moved to Washington in the summer before 5th grade. Although washington was a fun experience, I moved to Las Vegas a year later. Most people would have taken a plane to Las Vegas, my family and I drove down to Vegas to enjoy the extra scenes the drive has to offer. </p>
        <p class="AB">I am a student in Southwest CTA and currently in the Web Design program. Unlike most my classmates, I wasnt in Web Design for my Freshmen year. My first year in SWCTA, I was in the Interior Design program. Interior Design was a good class to be in, but I didn't have much interest in it as I thought i would. The next year, I transffered into Web Design. I may have lacked one year in learning programs useful to web design, but that doesnt stop me from learning more. </p>
