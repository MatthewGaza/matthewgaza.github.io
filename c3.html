            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The setting in this chapter is the various times Nick experiences the party from his home. &quot;At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam&quot; (39). The setting then moves to Gatsby&rsquo;s mansion. &quot;Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn&rsquo;t know---though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train&quot; (42).</p>
            <h3>Characterization</h3>
            <h4>Nick Carraway</h4>

            <ul>
                <li> In this chapter, Nick possesses independence and a shy, lonely atmosphere, until he and Jordan see each other. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - &quot;Dressed up in white flannels&quot; (41).</li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;But young men didn&rsquo;t---at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn&rsquo;t---drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound&quot; (49). &quot;You&rsquo;re a rotten driver... Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn&rsquo;t to drive at all&quot; (58).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jordan Baker</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - &quot;With Jordan&rsquo;s slender golden arm resting in mine, we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden&quot; (43). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;I don&rsquo;t know... I just don&rsquo;t think he went there&quot; (49). &quot;Anyhow, he gives large parties... And I like large parties. They&rsquo;re so intimate. At small parties there isn&rsquo;t any privacy&quot; (49). &quot;I&rsquo;ve just heard the most amazing thing&quot; (52). </li>
                <li><strong>Other characters&rsquo; thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn&rsquo;t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity&quot; (57).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Owl-Eyed Man</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>This man is seen as highly drunk. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books&quot;(45). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feeling, actions</strong> - &quot;Absolutely real - have pages and everything. I thought they&rsquo;d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they&rsquo;re absolutely real. Pages and - Here! Lemme show you&quot; (45). </li>
                <li><strong>Other characters&rsquo; thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering&quot; (46).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jay Gatsby</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Gatsby is seen as kind, jolly, giving. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;Precisely at that point it vanished---and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd&quot; (48). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>(To Nick)</i> &quot;Your face is familiar&quot; (47). &quot;Don&rsquo;t mention it... Don&rsquo;t give it another thought, old sport&quot; (53). </li>
                <li><strong>Other characters&rsquo; thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Nick</i>: &quot;Who is he... Do you know?&quot; (48).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>This chapter, while fully demonstrating the sheer wealth of Gatsby&rsquo;s legacy that reflected its historical context, served primarily to appease the reader&rsquo;s sense of mystery and enigma regarding Jay Gatsby by giving him a direct introduction. While this introduction did eliminate the hearsay basis of knowledge on the character, its bare and abstract description of Gatsby maintained, or even elevated, the sense of ambiguity that defined him. This is evident, for example, when he chooses to isolate himself from his own lavish expenditures and party guests, just as he chose to stand in solitude during the first chapter. While the majority of characters present in the plotline at this point appear to mask their moral pitfalls with grand displays of aristocracy, Gatsby&rsquo;s display is of a different, more profound purpose, which has yet to be revealed. </p>
