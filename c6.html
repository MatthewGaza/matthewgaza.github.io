        <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
        <p>This chapter offers the long sought-after, finalized revealment of Gatsby’s past, exploring his love for luxury and lavishness, as well as his dedication to success and all that it has to offer. This element from the past can also directly be connected to Gatsby’s current standing in the novel. Though the love shared between Gatsby and Daisy is not known at this point in the story by Tom Buchanan, he has a strong distaste for Daisy’s tendency to frequent Gatsby’s acquaintance. Furthermore, during the party, the combination of the overbearing environment and Tom’s watchful eye placed Daisy in a state great discomfort, which was apparent to Gatsby. This caused him to question the realization of his dream of love and happiness with her, effectively stirring internal conflict. </p>
