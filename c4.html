            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The chapter begins back at Gatsby&rsquo;s house. &quot;The world and its mistress returned to Gatsby&rsquo;s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn&quot; (Fitzgerald 61). Nick and Gatsby are in Gatsby&rsquo;s car, driving to New York City, going through deep discussions on the life of Gatsby. The setting then transitions to Nick, Gatsby, and a new character, Mr. Wolfsheim, enjoying each other&rsquo;s presence at a restaurant. Now, the narrator is Jordan Baker, and she is telling a story that took place in October, 1917. She tells the story &quot;In the tea garden at the Plaza Hotel&quot; (Fitzgerald 74).</p>
            <h3>Characterization</h3>
            <h4>Nick Carraway</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>In this chapter, Nick is very suspicious about Gatsby&rsquo;s description of his variety-filled life. He is further revealed as romantic, handsome, and skeptical. </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door&quot; (Fitzgerald 64). After seeing the constant parties at Gatsby&rsquo;s house, he loses his first thoughts about Gatsby and begins to develop suspicion. &quot;Anything can happen now that we&rsquo;ve sled over this bridge&quot; (Fitzgerald 69).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jay Gatsby</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Jay&rsquo;s description of the different life events that led to his success make him seem suspicious and mistrustful. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;He lifted up the words and nodded at them---with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro&rsquo;s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people&quot; (Fitzgerald 66). While he feels that Gatsby is fooling Nick, he notices this smile and begins to second-guess himself. </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - &quot;Anything can happen now that we&rsquo;ve slid over this bridge... Anything at all... &quot; (Fitzgerald 69). &quot;Miss Baker&rsquo;s a great sportswoman, you know, and she&rsquo;d never do anything that wasn&rsquo;t all right&quot; (Fitzgerald 71). </li>
                <li><strong>Other characters&rsquo; thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Meyer</i>: &quot;You&rsquo;re very polite, but I belong to another generation&quot; (Fitzgerald 72). <i>Narrator</i>: &quot;He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths---so that he could &rsquo;come over&rsquo; some afternoon to a stranger&rsquo;s garden&quot; (Fitzgerald 78). Nick experiences shock when he finds out that Gatsby bought his house only to be close to Daisy, his secret love.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Meyer Wolfsheim</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Wolfsheim is seen as a suspicious, shady, and dangerous man. </li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness” (Fitzgerald 69). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “This is a nice restaurant here… But I like the across the street better!” (Fitzgerald 70). “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman” (Fitzgerald 71). </li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Gatsby</i>: “He’s quite a character around New York---a denizen of Broadway” (Fitzgerald 73).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Jordan Baker</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - “I was happier on the lawn because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind” (Fitzgerald 74). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her the most” (Fitzgerald 75).</li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - <i>Narrator</i>: “Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm” (Fitzgerald 79).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Daisy Buchanan</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>In this chapter, Daisy is brought up as drunk and violent.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Appearance</strong> - “... and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress” (Fitzgerald 76). </li>
                <li><strong>Thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “’Gratulate me… Never had a drink before, but oh how I do enjoy it” (Fitzgerald 76). </li>
                <li><strong>Other characters’ thoughts, feelings, actions</strong> - “...and as drunk as a monkey” (Fitzgerald 76). “I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before” (Fitzgerald 76).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conflicts and Themes</h3>
            <p>This chapter appeases the readers’ sense of ambiguity surrounding Gatsby’s character and intent. His faux-midwestern (San Francisco, according to him) origins are finally given introduction and his mysterious conversation with Jordan Baker is finally detailed. The central theme of revealment gives the chapter a distinct level of importance and acts as a guide for the audience to follow in the book’s intended direction. However, the possibility that Gatsby’s acquaintance implies an unsavory source of wealth creates a possible conflict between him and various other characters present in the novel. Gatsby’s disclosure of his deep-rooted feelings for Daisy also allows room for conflict to sprout, setting the stage for resistance from Tom Buchanan and possibly from Daisy herself.</p>
