            <h3>Excerpt</h3>
            <p><i>“The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.”</i></p>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>The most striking and fruity paragraph on the page, this excerpt established the mood and tone in the Garage. It could even be said that the language here, parallels that of the story; dark and murky but with shadows of a light not to far off, but still far away. Dust-covered, dim, shadow, blind, spiritless, damp: These are all words that personify the Garage and its inhabitant, a place that sort of brings down what was a more hopeful atmosphere. However, despite its sad atmosphere, the overall tone is still strong, which is that of perseverance, dedication and how it will bring to fruit. It is almost ironic how the dark the garage is compared to the rich areas of town like the West Egg. The darkness of garages embodies the darkness of the conflict within the garage; Tom’s affair, while the innocent and blond old man represents the ignorance and the bliss that comes with it. The blond man is someone who, with a gleam of hope, hopes to live out his days peacefully. This peace also contradicts the turmoil that Tom brings and shows a conflict between the rich and poor, as well as between Tom and Wilson.</p>
